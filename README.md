# VicBlog Gatsby

VicBlog is migrating into a static website!

**This is a WIP project.**

Based on Gatsby v1 and [gatsby-starter-typescript-plus](https://github.com/resir014/gatsby-starter-typescript-plus)

## Developing

Yarn instead of NPM is required.

``` bash
# install dependencies
yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
yarn start

# run production build
yarn run build
```

## Credits

Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) - the blazing-fast static site generator for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).
